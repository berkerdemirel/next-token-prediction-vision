This project will demonstrate how good the next token prediction representations are for the vision datasets.

## Datasets to include
- CIFAR100
- MNIST

## Goals
- Tokenize the pixel space
- Create a transformer architecture like GPT2's 
- Train the model to predict the next token given the pixels so far

The architecture will be decoder only transformer.

## Tools
- uv for environment creation
- pytorch ligthning for training
- hydra + yaml files for hyperparams
- wandb for logging

After the pretraining is done, i will evaluate the quality of the representations for the tasks
- classification
- reconstruction

please suggest me other downstream tasks that are easy to check and evaluate
